## This is an `<h2>` header

###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest
```

#### How it looks

# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest

## This is an `<h2>` header

###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit your file with headers

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Open the **pull requests** tab.
1. Click **New pull request**, for the branches to compare, select `base: main` and `compare: start-markdown`.
1. Click **Create pull request**.
1. In this pull request, go to the **Files changed** tab. We made an empty file `index.md` for you.
1. Select **Edit file** from the three dotted **...** menu in the upper right corner of the file view on `index.md`.
1. On the **Edit file** tab, add a `#`, followed by a **space**, before any content you like to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six `#` characters followed by a **space**.
1. Above your new content, click **Preview**.
1. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.
1. Click **Commit changes**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
